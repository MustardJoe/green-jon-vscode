# green-jon-vscode

Hello, and thank you for joining me here.  While I was a coding student at at prominent Portland, OR coding bootcamp, I was introduced to the joys of VSCode and in particular, the ways in which I could customize this wonderful editor to my desired preferences.  In additional to all sorts of extensions that help to make the task of writing code more streamlined or straightforward, I also had a blast finding more of the 'fun' extensions (PoweMode, all sorts of other color themes) for my editor.  But ultimately I was dismayed at the lack of what I considered to be a 'good' green color theme.  And when I say green, I mean really green.  Lots of green.  Not grey background with green text.  EVERYTHING GREEN kind of green, but without an obnoxous contrast that would begin to strain your eyes after a few minutes.  

So now I begin my work to help bring a very green (with a sustainable amount of medium-level color contrast) color theme to life.
